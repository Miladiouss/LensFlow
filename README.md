# LensFlow
A deep learning algorithm for identifying strong gravitational lenses.

It is written in the Wolfram Language and contains the core part of our algorithm. The documentation is captured in the notebook itself.

#### Handy COSMOS ACS Functions.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook contains simple but useful functions such as automating SourceExtractor, lenstool, creating cutouts, and many more useful functions to prepare FITS images for deep learning. Even though the notebook contains documentation and most defined functions have doc strings, it was written for my own personal use and has not been cleaned up. I just thought it might be useful to share it with people who are new to the field of observational astrophysics/cosmology.
